# Manual test checklist

## T1 rts-contracts

- [ ] Launch `cargo run -- rts` and confirm the tracked map still renders at the same 320×320 scale it did before this change (no visual resize).
- [ ] Select a worker and a soldier, issue a move order across open ground, and confirm both units now visibly move noticeably faster than before (workers ~30 cells/sec, soldiers ~24 cells/sec — roughly 3x the old pace).
- [ ] Confirm the worker still clearly outruns the soldier when both are sent to the same distant point together.
- [ ] Click-select a unit at its edge (near the current selection ring) and confirm picking still feels correct — the pick radius now reflects a 3-cell body instead of 6-cell.
- [ ] Confirm no visual or behavioral regression in building placement, gather, or production flows during a few minutes of normal play.
